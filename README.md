# Smart-Parking-Assist
Project developed in C. I implemented a concurrent UDP server that allows  multiple users to log in simultaneously, check available parking spots in real time, and reserve them in a database  managed on the server. The system handled client concurrency, dynamic updates of parking availability, and  clientâ€“server communication.
